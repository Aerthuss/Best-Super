                <h3> How super funds invest your money</h3>
                <p> Super funds invest your money to grow your 'nest egg' over the span of your working life. Most super funds will let you choose a range of investment options. The difference between investment options is mainly how much investment risk you are willing to take on. </p>
                <hr class = "magLine">
                
                <h3> Type of investment options </h3>
                <h4> Growth </h4>
                <p> Invests around 85% of your super fund in shares or property. This investment will aim for higher average returns over the long term. This also means that you will experience worse losses in bad years than those you would with lower risk options. You may also be able to invest in a 'high growth' option with 100% in shares and property, however, this is rather risky. </p>
                <h4> Balanced </h4>
                <p> Invests around 70% of your super fund in shares or property. The rest of your super fund is fixed interest and cash. This aims for possible returns, but less returns than a Growth fund would be able to achieve, which also reduces risk of losses in bad years. These losses occur less frequently than in the Growth option, as you are risking less of your super fund. You may also be able to invest in a 'moderate' option with around 50% of your super fund in shares and property. </p>
                <h4> Conservative </h4>
                <p> Invests around 30% of your super fund in shares and property with the majority of your super fund invested in fixed interest and cash. This option aims to reduce the risk of loss, therefore reducing the chance of experiencing a bad investment year. </p>
                <h4> Cash </h4>
                <p> Invests 100% of your super funds in deposits with Australian deposit-taking institutions or in a 'capital guaranteed' life insurance policy. This option has aims to guarantee your capital and accumulated earnings cannot be reduced by losses on investments.</p>
                <hr class = "magLine">
                
                <h3> Pick a suitable investment option </h3>
                <p> Most people will work for an average of 30 to 40 years of their life, and perhaps live for the next 25-30 years after retiring. During your time at work, you would want your super to grow and keep pace with inflation during this time. </p>
                <p> For this reason, a growth or balanced strategy may suit a long-term investor who won't be spending their super for more than 10 years. </p>
                <p> Going with a higher risk strategy may deliver higher investment returns, however, the risk is losses in bad years. Over 30 to 40 years, it is likely that any growth strategy will lose money in at least 4 to 6 of these years. However, there are likely to be more ups than downs. </p>
                <p> Historically, a growth or balanced strategy has given better returns than more conservative options over 20 years. It is up to you to decide wether or not the risk is worth it for you or not. </p>
                <hr class = "magLine">
                
                <h3> Think before you choose </h3>
                <p> As you are still young, you won't be accessing your super for 5 or more years, so your focus should be on what it's likely to be worth in the future, after 20 to 30 or so years. Your investment value doesn't matter for what it's worth day by day, in the same way the value of your property doesn't matter from day to day. It only matters when you come to selling it, but in this case, deposit your super. </p>
