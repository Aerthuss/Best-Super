                <p class = "caption"> Your super may have some hidden talents that you don't know about.</p>
                <hr class = "magLine">    
            
                <p> Most of us think of our super as a long-term savings account. And let’s face it, that's what super was designed for. But there are a few ways your super can be put to work right now that you might not have thought about. </p>
                <hr class = "magLine">
                
                <h3> It's almost 10% of your salary </h3>
                <p> That’s a significant amount in anyone’s language. And when you consider that the average person has around $45,0001 in their super by their mid-to-late 30s, it makes good sense to think about super as more than just a deduction on your payslip.</p>
                <hr class = "magLine">
                
                <h3> Take an interest in how your super is invested </h3>
                <p> While you can’t choose whether to put money into super, you can choose where and how your money is invested.</p>
                <br>
                <p> As with any money you’re investing, history has shown that over a 10 year period if you keep itin cash your balance is likely to be less than if you put it into property or shares. The same is true of your super. So it’s worth spending a few minutes choosing an investment option that will help your money grow.</p>
                <hr class = "magLine">
                
                <h3> Buy shares in companies that you would like to invest in </h3>
                <p> Options like Self Invest let you use your super to do just that. You can invest some of your super in any of the top 300 ASX listed companies as well as some exchange traded funds. Find out more about how Self Invest works and eligibility criteria.</p>
                <hr class = "magLine">
                
                <h3> Life insurance that doesn't hit the hip pocket </h3>
                <p> If you have a mortgage, children or other financial commitments, you’ve possibly thought about getting some kind of life or income protection insurance.</p>
                <br>
                <p> While your super most likely includes some insurance as standard, for many people it isn’t enough. You can usually get additional insurance through your super with no out of pocket expenses (it’s all paid through your super).</p>
                <hr class = "magLine">
                
                <h3> Remember it's your money </h3>
                <p> It never hurts to talk to someone to make sure you’re making the most of your hard earned money. And it’s easy to get in touch with us. Contact us and have a conversation about putting your super to work for you today. </p>
