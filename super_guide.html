                <h3> Are you currently employed ? </h3>
                <p> If you're older than 18 and earning more than $450 per month, your employer has to pay you super. If you're under 18 and you're working more than 30 hours a week, you should also be paid super. </p>
                <hr class = "magLine">
                
                <h3> Choosing your super fund </h3>
                <p> When you start working at a new job, your employer should give you information about your super choices, and also let you know what their default super fund is. You may be able to choose your own fund. If you're unsure about this, it won't hurt to ask your employer.</p>
                <hr class = "magLine">
                
                <h3> Contributions into your super </h3>
                <p> Once you start working, your employer needs to pay contributions into your super account, which is currently equal to 9.5% of your salary. Super contributions will be increasing in the near future, so you'll be getting more super.</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li> You can also make your own contributions to your super from your after-tax salary, or you can ask your employer to make extra contributions from your before-tax salary. </li>
                        <li> A before-tax contribution is called a salary sacrifice contribution. This method of contribution cna be an effective way of adding to your super, as these contributions are taxed at a maximum of only 15%, instead of your marginal tax rate.
                        </li>
                        <li> There are maximum limits to the amount of contributions you can make tax-effectively, so always check that your contributions fall within the maximum cap rate to avoid higher tax rates. </li>
                    </ul>
                <hr class ="magLine">
                
                <h3> Staying on track </h3>
                <p> Money in your super fun is typically invested in the option(s) you've chosen, for example, shares in the Australian market, Fixed Interest, Properties, or a mixture of all. If you don'y make a choice, your money will be invested in the default investment option of the super fund you have chosen. Some funds may also offer 'lifestage options', which invest your super based on your age. As you grow closer to retirement, your investment mix will change to include more defensive assets, such as Cash and Fixed Interest. </p>
                <br>
                <p> To help you keep a track of all your investments, your super fund will also send you regular statements to let you know how your savings are going. </p>
                <hr class = "magLine">
                <h3> Changing Jobs </h3>
                <p> Don't forget about your super when you start a new job. If you're able to choose your own super fund, simply complete a Super Choice form with your existing super fund's details and hand it in to your new employer. </p>
                <br>
                <p> If you're unable to choose your own fund (because your company has a default super), you may want to transfer your existing super into your new fund. Having all of your super in the one fund will make it easier to keep track of your invested money, as well as potentially helping you save on fees. However, before you make any changes to your super fund, consider things such as any insurance cover you may have and any exit fees. </p>
                <hr class = "magLine">
                
                <h3> Accessing your money </h3>
                <p> Generally, your superannuation money needs to stay invested until you're ready to retire and have reached your 'preservation age', which is between the ages of 55 and 60, depending on your date of birth. Unless you're expecting sever financial hardship, incapacitated or seriously ill, you won't be able to access your super fund until your preservation age. </p>
